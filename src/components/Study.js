				<h3>Why Choose Canada?</h3>
				<p>
					Choose to study in Canada, and you’ll have the opportunity to
					encounter vastly different cultural and natural experiences – from the
					ski slopes of British Columbia to the prairie province of Manitoba,
					with cities such as Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver and Quebec famously
					friendly, tolerant and multicultural.
				</p>
				<p>
					Occupying the northern half of the North American continent, Canada is
					known for its natural beauty – few nations in the world can boast
					anything close to its wealth of forests, lakes and mountains – and for
					its multicultural diversity. The country has official bilingual
					status, with English and French used concurrently in government and
					official documents.
